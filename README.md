# Double Transposition Cipher

This repository contains a Python implementation of a double transposition cipher. The double transposition cipher is a simple symmetric cipher that encrypts text by rearranging it using a key.

## Description

The script prompts the user for a plaintext message and two keys. It then performs a double transposition cipher on the message using these keys, displaying each step of the process for learning purposes.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started. 

[backtick][backtick][backtick]bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DoubleTranspositionCipher.git
cd DoubleTranspositionCipher
[backtick][backtick][backtick]

## Usage

To use this program, navigate to the directory where it's located and run the Python script:

[backtick][backtick][backtick]bash
python3 double_transposition_cipher.py
[backtick][backtick][backtick]

When prompted, input the message you want to encrypt and the two keys you want to use for the encryption. The program will then perform the encryption and display the process.
